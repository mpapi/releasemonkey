= ReleaseMonkey

ReleaseMonkey is a simple tool to manage releases.

It is still very much in progress.  Feel free to play with it and submit ideas and patches back.

= Installing

Assuming you have virtualenv and pip installed, you should be able to run create-env.sh.  This will create an env directory with all the python deps fulfilled, and you can source env/bin/activate as normal to enter the virtual env.

To create the sqlite database you should run the create-db.py script in the releasemonkey subdir.
